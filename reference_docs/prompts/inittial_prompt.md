Please review my system prompt and the following documentation.

For now, just confirm that you understand the context and then acknowledge it. Next, I will share more details.

***********************

We are following the implementation plan step by step.

I already execute the steps marked with an 'x' in the 'small implementation plan' file.

## Checklist of Steps

1. **Project Initialization**
    - [x] Create the project directory structure.
    - [x] Initialize npm and set up the development environment.
    - [x] Configure TypeScript compiler options.

2. **Set Up Version Control**
    - [x] Initialize a Git repository.
    - [x] Create a `.gitignore` file.

3. **Install Dependencies**
    - [x] Install VS Code extension development dependencies.
    - [x] Install Sherpa-onnx Node.js package.

4. **Create Essential Files**
    - [x] Create the extension manifest (`package.json`).
    - [x] Create the main extension entry point (`extension.ts`).
    - [x] Set up the Webview files (`index.html`, `script.js`, `style.css`).
    - [x] Configure VS Code launch and task configurations.

5. **Implement STT Functionality**
    - [x] Download the STT/ASR models.
    - [x] Set up audio input capture in the Webview.
    - [x] Integrate Sherpa-onnx STT processing in the extension.
    - [x] Handle transcription results and display them in the IDE.

6. **Implement TTS Functionality**
    - [x] Download the TTS models.
    - [x] Capture text input or selection from the user.
    - [x] Integrate Sherpa-onnx TTS processing in the extension.
    - [x] Play the synthesized audio in the Webview.

7. **Handle Permissions and Security**
    - [ ] Implement microphone permission requests.
    - [ ] Set up Content Security Policy (CSP) for the Webview.
    - [ ] Ensure data privacy by keeping processing local.

For your reference, here is my plan for the substeps in step 7. Use them as a guide to complete the steps, but feel free to deviate if you see a better way.

### 7. Handle Permissions and Security

Implement proper permission requests for accessing the microphone, providing clear messages to the user about why permissions are needed. Set up a Content Security Policy for the webview to enhance security and prevent unauthorized content execution. Ensure that all data processing occurs locally, maintaining user privacy and data security.

#### a. Implement Microphone Permission Requests

Ensure that the webview properly requests microphone access and handles user denial gracefully.

#### b. Set Up Content Security Policy (CSP) for the Webview

In `extension.ts`, when setting the HTML content, include a nonce and define a strict CSP:

```typescript
function getWebviewContent(context: vscode.ExtensionContext, webview: vscode.Webview): string {
  const nonce = getNonce();
  // Replace '{{nonce}}' in index.html with the generated nonce
  // Set CSP in the HTML head
}
```

#### c. Ensure Data Privacy by Keeping Processing Local

Confirm that all data processing occurs locally and no data is sent to external servers.

Before continuing, review the steps already marked as executed to ensure completeness and correctness.
