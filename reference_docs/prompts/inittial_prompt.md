# Project Context: TTS-STT for Cursor Extension Development

## Project Overview
We are developing a Visual Studio Code extension named "TTS-STT for Cursor," which integrates speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) functionalities using the Sherpa-ONNX framework. This extension is being developed in TypeScript and leverages the sherpa-onnx-node native addon for integration. By utilizing the Node.js addon, the project benefits from native performance and multi-threading support, ensuring efficient and real-time processing of speech data directly within the VS Code environment. This approach allows for seamless integration and execution of Sherpa-ONNX capabilities, providing users with robust STT and TTS features without the need for external services or platform-specific binaries.

## Current Challenge
We are encountering initialization errors with Sherpa-onnx, specifically:
- Error message: "Please check your config!"

## ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ Research Objective: Understanding Sherpa-onnx Requirements

The primary focus of our next session is to conduct a thorough investigation of Sherpa-onnx's implementation requirements and expected configurations. This research phase is crucial as we've encountered initialization errors that suggest a misalignment between our current configuration approach and Sherpa-onnx's expectations.

### Key Research Areas
1. **Model Structure Requirements**
   - Understanding the expected organization of model files
   - Verifying correct file paths and relationships between model components
   - Identifying any specific file naming conventions or dependencies

2. **Configuration Schema Analysis**
   - Deep dive into Sherpa-onnx's configuration object structure
   - Understanding required vs optional parameters
   - Investigating parameter types and acceptable values
   - Examining the relationship between different configuration options

3. **Initialization Process**
   - Understanding the sequence of initialization steps
   - Identifying potential validation checks performed by Sherpa-onnx
   - Understanding error handling and configuration validation

4. **Integration Patterns**
   - Studying recommended integration approaches
   - Understanding best practices for Node.js addon usage
   - Examining memory management and resource handling

### Expected Outcomes
1. Clear understanding of correct configuration structure
2. Documented model file organization requirements
3. Proper initialization sequence
4. Error handling strategy
5. Updated type definitions reflecting actual requirements

This research phase is critical for resolving our current initialization issues and ensuring robust integration of Sherpa-onnx into our extension. The findings will directly inform necessary modifications to our configuration approach and type definitions.

This context will be used to analyze Sherpa-onnx documentation and determine the correct configuration structure for both STT and TTS initialization.
