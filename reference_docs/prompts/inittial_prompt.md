# Project Context: TTS-STT for Cursor Extension Development

## Project Overview
We are developing a VS Code extension called "TTS-STT for Cursor" that integrates speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities using the Sherpa-onnx framework. The extension is being developed in TypeScript and uses the sherpa-onnx-node native addon.

## Current Implementation State
We have successfully implemented:
1. Basic extension structure
2. Model management system
3. Automatic model extraction from .tar.bz2 files
4. Type definitions for Sherpa-onnx interfaces
5. Basic UI with webview integration

## Current Challenge
We are encountering initialization errors with Sherpa-onnx, specifically:
- Error message: "Please check your config!"
- Location: During OnlineRecognizer initialization
- Context: After model extraction and verification succeeds

```

## Recent Progress
1. Successfully implemented model extraction without intermediary folders
2. Fixed circular reference issues in debugging
3. Updated type definitions for Sherpa-onnx
4. Implemented proper configuration structure for STT/TTS

## Current Configuration
```typescript
const sttConfig: OnlineRecognizerConfig = {
    transducer: {
        encoder: "[path]/encoder-epoch-99-avg-1-chunk-16-left-128.int8.onnx",
        decoder: "[path]/decoder-epoch-99-avg-1-chunk-16-left-128.int8.onnx",
        joiner: "[path]/joiner-epoch-99-avg-1-chunk-16-left-128.int8.onnx",
    },
    tokens: "[path]/tokens.txt",
    featConfig: {
        sampleRate: 16000,
        featureDim: 80
    },
    decodingConfig: {
        method: "greedy_search"
    },
    enableEndpoint: true
};
```

## Next Steps
1. Review Sherpa-onnx documentation for correct configuration requirements
2. Verify model file structure matches Sherpa-onnx expectations
3. Implement proper error handling for configuration issues
4. Test initialization with verified configuration

## Critical Points for Continuation
1. The models are successfully extracted and verified
2. All required files are present and accessible
3. The configuration structure is defined but may need adjustment
4. We need to understand Sherpa-onnx's exact configuration requirements

## ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ Research Objective: Understanding Sherpa-onnx Requirements

The primary focus of our next session is to conduct a thorough investigation of Sherpa-onnx's implementation requirements and expected configurations. This research phase is crucial as we've encountered initialization errors that suggest a misalignment between our current configuration approach and Sherpa-onnx's expectations.

### Key Research Areas
1. **Model Structure Requirements**
   - Understanding the expected organization of model files
   - Verifying correct file paths and relationships between model components
   - Identifying any specific file naming conventions or dependencies

2. **Configuration Schema Analysis**
   - Deep dive into Sherpa-onnx's configuration object structure
   - Understanding required vs optional parameters
   - Investigating parameter types and acceptable values
   - Examining the relationship between different configuration options

3. **Initialization Process**
   - Understanding the sequence of initialization steps
   - Identifying potential validation checks performed by Sherpa-onnx
   - Understanding error handling and configuration validation

4. **Integration Patterns**
   - Studying recommended integration approaches
   - Understanding best practices for Node.js addon usage
   - Examining memory management and resource handling

### Research Sources
- Official Sherpa-onnx documentation
- Node.js addon examples and documentation
- Implementation examples and reference code
- Community discussions and issue trackers

### Expected Outcomes
1. Clear understanding of correct configuration structure
2. Documented model file organization requirements
3. Proper initialization sequence
4. Error handling strategy
5. Updated type definitions reflecting actual requirements

This research phase is critical for resolving our current initialization issues and ensuring robust integration of Sherpa-onnx into our extension. The findings will directly inform necessary modifications to our configuration approach and type definitions.

This context will be used to analyze Sherpa-onnx documentation and determine the correct configuration structure for both STT and TTS initialization.
