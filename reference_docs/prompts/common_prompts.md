# IDE Already Implemented Changes

It seems my IDE has already implemented some or all of your suggestions. However, it would be prudent to verify and double-check the latest version of the files to ensure they are complete and accurate. Could you please review all the changes we've made to confirm they are fully implemented and correct?

# Verify and Double-Check Changes

It is wise to verify and double-check the latest version of the files to ensure they are complete and accurate, and that they were **implemented as intended**. Could you review all the changes we've made to confirm they are fully implemented and correct?

# Ensure Other Files Are Adjusted

## Identify and List All Affected Files

Do we need to adjust any other files in the codebase as a result of this change?

## Propose holistic implementation

Propose a specific implementation approach based on these findings.  

Keep in mind that a change of this nature will impact multiple files across our codebase. Ensure that we identify and list all affected files, including those indirectly impacted.

## Holistic evaluation

Before making any changes, it is crucial to evaluate their potential impact across the codebase. Consider what other components might require adjustment if we proceed with the proposed solution. Anticipating these dependencies is essential to avoid introducing new issues elsewhere.

Therefore, start by thoroughly assessing the issue, conceptualizing a solution, and reflecting on the broader implications of its implementation. Let’s approach this holistically to ensure stability and coherence throughout the codebase.

# Session Notes Action, Issues, and Outcomes

Please create the notes to record the latest modifications. Ensure it addresses all the critical questions comprehensively:  

1. What prompted us to take action?  
2. What issue was identified?  
3. Why was this solution chosen?  
4. What solution was implemented?  
5. What outcome is anticipated?  

The session notes should provide detailed and thoughtful responses to these questions, even if the questions themselves are not explicitly stated in the text. Prioritize a narrative style.

# Clarify and Research

I'm uncertain about how to proceed with {issue}. Could you clarify the correct way to approach this?  

I believe we need to research the proper method and determine what is expected in this context. This information likely already exists online, so we should create targeted search queries to retrieve it and then analyze the results.  

We may have encountered this issue before but didn’t document it, so it’s essential to track it in the session notes. Our online research should aim to clarify the methods and structures available to handle {issue} effectively. Additionally, we should look into other projects that may have faced similar challenges and review the solutions they implemented.  

While conducting this research, we must maintain clarity about our objective. If the issue we’re addressing is limited to this specific point, we should focus on resolving it rather than re-evaluating the entire implementation related to {issue}.  

The key is to answer these questions:  
- What exactly are we trying to achieve?  
- What is the purpose of addressing {issue}?  

In this initial step, we should focus on understanding the problem, asking the right questions, and establishing a clear direction. This will guide our web search effectively. Based on the information we gather, we can then create a plan to implement the necessary changes.

# Research and evaluate the results

@Web 

1. **Analyze the Web Search Results:**
   - Review each search result obtained from the previous coding-related queries.

2. **Critically Evaluate Relevance:**
   - Assess how each result specifically relates to the coding issue or error.
   - Identify and disregard any irrelevant or unrelated information.

3. **Determine Solution Viability:**
   - For relevant results, determine if they offer practical and accurate solutions.
   - Consider the credibility and applicability of the information provided.

4. **Make a Clear Decision:**
   - State whether the retrieved information is adequate to resolve the coding issue.
   - Justify your decision based on the analysis.

5. **Suggest Next Steps:**
   - If the information is adequate, recommend specific coding actions or debugging steps.
   - If not, propose new, refined search queries focusing on exact error messages, programming languages, libraries, or frameworks involved.

**Instructions:**

- **Be Objective and Rigorous:** Do not accept information at face value; critically assess its relevance and accuracy.
- **Present Clearly and Concisely:** Use headings, bullet points, or numbered lists for clarity.
- **Address Each Task Directly:** Ensure your response covers all the points outlined above.

# Proceed in logical order and provide updates

Proceed in the most logical order for the task. At the end of each step or phase, provide a clear update on the implementation progress, presenting what has been completed and what remains to be done.

Please let me know in advance if you require me to share with you the entire content of any file.

# Consult the Codebase and Project Structure

- Please consult the @Codebase for overall details and locate the information or file you need. You may be able to access them directly.
- Refer to the @project_structure.txt file for a structured view of the project's relevant files (.ts, .js, .json, .md, .ps1) and directories. Note that standard development folders (node_modules, .git, .vscode), hidden files, and package-lock.json are excluded from this view.

**Note:** The shared information (snippets and excerpts) might be incomplete due to length restrictions. If you need to consult or edit a specific file, please request its full content in advance to ensure you have access to all necessary details.
