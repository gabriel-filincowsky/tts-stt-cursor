## Detailed Implementation Steps

### 1. Project Initialization

Establish the foundational directory structure, including directories for configurations, dependencies, compiled outputs, media assets, source code, and documentation. Initialize npm and install TypeScript globally. Configure the TypeScript compiler with appropriate options, ensuring strict type checking and compatibility.

### 2. Set Up Version Control

Initialize a Git repository to manage version control and create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files such as `node_modules`, `out`, and `.vscode` directories.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary development packages for building VS Code extensions and the Sherpa-onnx Node.js addon to enable STT and TTS functionalities within the extension.


### 4. Create Essential Files

Update the `package.json` file with extension metadata (using package name 'tts-stt-cursor'), activation events, contributions, scripts, and dependencies. Create the main extension entry point, importing required modules and setting up the activation function and command registrations. Develop the webview files, including HTML content for the interface, JavaScript for handling user interactions and communication with the extension, and CSS for styling. Configure VS Code launch and task configurations to facilitate debugging and development.

### 5. Implement STT Functionality

In the webview, set up audio input capture using the Web Audio API, handling user permissions and potential errors. Integrate Sherpa-onnx STT processing in the extension, converting audio data received from the webview into text. Handle the transcription results by displaying them to the user or inserting them into the editor.

### 6. Implement TTS Functionality

Capture text input from the user or obtain selected text from the editor. Integrate Sherpa-onnx TTS processing to synthesize speech from the text input. Send the synthesized audio back to the webview for playback, ensuring smooth and synchronized audio output.

### 7. Handle Permissions and Security

Implement proper permission requests for accessing the microphone, providing clear messages to the user about why permissions are needed. Set up a Content Security Policy for the webview to enhance security and prevent unauthorized content execution. Ensure that all data processing occurs locally, maintaining user privacy and data security.

#### a. Implement Microphone Permission Requests

Ensure that the webview properly requests microphone access and handles user denial gracefully.

#### b. Set Up Content Security Policy (CSP) for the Webview

In `extension.ts`, when setting the HTML content, include a nonce and define a strict CSP:

```typescript
function getWebviewContent(context: vscode.ExtensionContext, webview: vscode.Webview): string {
  const nonce = getNonce();
  // Replace '{{nonce}}' in index.html with the generated nonce
  // Set CSP in the HTML head
}
```

#### c. Ensure Data Privacy by Keeping Processing Local

Confirm that all data processing occurs locally and no data is sent to external servers.

### 8. Testing and Debugging

Test the extension's functionality across different operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, to ensure cross-platform compatibility. Use debugging tools to identify and resolve issues, optimizing performance and resource usage. Validate the user experience by ensuring the interface is responsive and provides appropriate feedback during operations.

### 9. Prepare for Distribution

Update documentation, including the README and CHANGELOG files, providing clear installation instructions, feature descriptions, and version history. Package the extension using VSCE, ensuring that all necessary files and assets are included. Test the packaged extension installation in VS Code or Cursor to verify that it installs correctly and functions as intended.

### 10. Publish and Maintain

Publish the extension to the marketplace if applicable, following submission guidelines and providing necessary metadata and assets. Set up a workflow for updates and maintenance, planning for regular updates, bug fixes, and feature enhancements. Engage with users by creating channels for feedback, such as an issue tracker or contact email, to continuously improve the extension based on user input.
