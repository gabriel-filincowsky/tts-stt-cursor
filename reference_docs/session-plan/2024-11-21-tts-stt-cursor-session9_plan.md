# Previous Session Notes Summaries

## Summary of Session 1 ([Go to Session](2024-11-17-tts-stt-cursor-Session1.md))

The TTS-STT Cursor Extension project aims to integrate Sherpa-ONNX's speech processing capabilities into the Cursor IDE using TypeScript and native Node.js bindings. The foundational infrastructure is complete, but the team is currently debugging a critical initialization failure manifesting as a "Please check your config!" error.

## Summary of Session 2 ([Go to Session](2024-11-18-tts-stt-cursor-Session2.md))

The team resolved an installation failure caused by circular dependencies and premature access to VS Code APIs during setup. By restructuring the setup scripts and deferring VS Code API usage to runtime, they ensured a successful installation process.

## Summary of Session 3 ([Go to Session](2024-11-18-tts-stt-cursor-Session3.md))

An overhaul of the version management system was conducted to address issues like inconsistent version states and redundant binary downloads. Centralized version tracking, validation state tracking, and improved binary management were implemented to enhance system stability and performance.

## Summary of Session 4 ([Go to Session](2024-11-19-tts-stt-cursor-Session4.md))

The team enhanced version state management and GPU integration to address architectural weaknesses causing inconsistent version states and improper GPU detection. Centralized state management and platform-specific GPU initialization were implemented to improve stability and performance.

## Summary of Session 5 ([Go to Session](2024-11-19-tts-stt-cursor-Session5.md))

The team investigated GitHub release asset management to resolve issues with binary selection and platform detection that were causing installation failures. They planned to improve asset selection logic and implement fallback mechanisms by analyzing GitHub's Release API and similar projects.

## Summary of Session 6 ([Go to Session](2024-11-19-tts-stt-cursor-Session6.md))

Addressing test failures and compilation errors, the team restructured the test infrastructure to align with VS Code extension standards, enabling proper test isolation and fixture management. They centralized version state management for reliable state persistence and improved asset handling with platform-aware selection and better error handling, enhancing test reliability and maintainability.

## Summary of Session 7 ([Go to Session](2024-11-19-tts-stt-cursor-Session7.md))

The team resolved multiple test failures and TypeScript compilation errors by fixing module resolution, updating package dependencies, and improving test framework implementation. All tests passed successfully with improved execution time and clean TypeScript compilation. The session also revealed potential issues with command registration and extension activation that needed further investigation.

## Summary of Session 8 ([Go to Session](2024-11-20-tts-stt-cursor-Session8.md))

A critical code recovery and implementation audit was initiated after discovering that previous working implementations may have been overwritten or fragmented. The team identified the need for thorough code archaeology and documentation of existing functionality, planning to review Git history and map all implementation attempts to ensure no working code is lost.
