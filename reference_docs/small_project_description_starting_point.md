# Project Description Starting Point

## Introduction

The aim of this project is to develop a Visual Studio Code extension called "TTS-STT for Cursor" that integrates the Sherpa-onnx framework to provide speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) functionalities within the Cursor IDE, a modern fork of VS Code. This extension will enable users to interact with the IDE using voice commands and receive auditory feedback, enhancing accessibility and productivity. By directly integrating Sherpa-onnx into the extension's TypeScript code, we eliminate the need for external processes or servers, simplifying user setup and improving performance.

## Implementation Plan

### Leveraging Sherpa-onnx Node.js Integration

Sherpa-onnx offers integration with Node.js through a native addon (C++ Addon) and WebAssembly (WASM). The native addon provides efficient execution with native performance and support for multi-threading but requires handling native binaries for different platforms and ensuring compatibility with the Node.js version used by VS Code (Electron's Node.js version). WASM runs in any environment that supports it and simplifies distribution without platform-specific binaries but may have limitations with multi-threading and potential performance overhead.

### Updated Extension Development Strategy

The strategy involves directly integrating Sherpa-onnx into the extension without external applications. All necessary dependencies will be bundled within the extension to ensure it works out-of-the-box after installation.

### Adjusted Implementation Steps

1. **Set Up Development Environment**: Install Node.js and TypeScript, and initialize the extension project with the appropriate directory structure.
2. **Install Sherpa-onnx Packages**: Install the Sherpa-onnx Node.js addon and set environment variables if required.
3. **Implement STT Functionality**: Use the Webview API to create a panel that captures audio using the Web Audio API. Process audio data with Sherpa-onnx to obtain transcriptions and integrate with Cursor's UI to display the transcribed text.
4. **Implement TTS Functionality**: Capture text from the chat output or user selection, synthesize speech using Sherpa-onnx, and play the generated audio in the webview.
5. **Handle Permissions and Security**: Ensure that microphone and audio access permissions are appropriately handled in the webview, informing users about data usage and privacy.
6. **Testing and Optimization**: Conduct cross-platform testing on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Optimize performance by evaluating latency and refining audio data handling. Ensure the user interface is responsive and provides feedback during processing.

## Project Structure and Development Environment

Organize the project with a clear directory structure (using 'tts_stt_cursor' as the root directory), including configurations for debugging and tasks, dependencies, source code, webview assets, and documentation. Set up the development environment by installing necessary dependencies and configuring TypeScript and VS Code settings.

## Implementing Extension Functionality

Develop the main extension entry point ('tts-stt-cursor' package), importing required modules and initializing Sherpa-onnx. Create the webview implementation with HTML content, scripts for handling user interactions and audio processing, and styles for the interface. Register commands and handle communication between the extension and the webview.

## Testing and Packaging

Test the extension's functionality thoroughly, including running it in VS Code, setting breakpoints, and ensuring permissions are correctly requested. Package the extension using VSCE, ensuring that all necessary files are included, and test the packaged extension installation.

## Potential Challenges and Solutions

- **Handling Native Modules**: Include pre-built binaries for different platforms and ensure compatibility with the Node.js version used by Electron.
- **WebAssembly Limitations**: Test the WASM implementation for performance and use it as a fallback if necessary, informing users about potential differences.
- **Audio Handling in Webview**: Implement efficient data transfer and adhere to security practices, such as using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to secure the webview content.

## Overview of the End Product

The extension will provide STT and TTS functionalities, allowing users to interact with the IDE via voice input and output. The user interface will include a webview panel with controls for starting STT and TTS, integrated seamlessly into the IDE. The extension will prioritize performance, data privacy, and compatibility across different operating systems.

## Additional Tips

- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling with user-friendly messages.
- **Logging**: Use logging for debugging during development but minimize it in production.
- **User Settings**: Allow users to configure settings such as voice parameters or language models.
- **Updates and Maintenance**: Keep the extension updated and monitor user feedback for improvements.

## Conclusion

By following this implementation plan, we will establish a solid foundation for developing a functional and user-friendly extension that enhances accessibility and productivity within the Cursor IDE. Careful planning, adherence to best practices, and a focus on user experience will ensure the extension meets its objectives effectively.
