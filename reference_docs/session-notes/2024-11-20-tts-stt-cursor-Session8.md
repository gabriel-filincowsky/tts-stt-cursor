# Previous Session Summaries

## Summary of Session 1 ([Go to Session](2024-11-17-tts-stt-cursor-Session1.md))

The TTS-STT Cursor Extension project aims to integrate Sherpa-ONNX's speech processing capabilities into the Cursor IDE using TypeScript and native Node.js bindings. The foundational infrastructure is complete, but the team is currently debugging a critical initialization failure manifesting as a "Please check your config!" error.

## Summary of Session 2 ([Go to Session](2024-11-18-tts-stt-cursor-Session2.md))

The team resolved an installation failure caused by circular dependencies and premature access to VS Code APIs during setup. By restructuring the setup scripts and deferring VS Code API usage to runtime, they ensured a successful installation process.

## Summary of Session 3 ([Go to Session](2024-11-18-tts-stt-cursor-Session3.md))

An overhaul of the version management system was conducted to address issues like inconsistent version states and redundant binary downloads. Centralized version tracking, validation state tracking, and improved binary management were implemented to enhance system stability and performance.

## Summary of Session 4 ([Go to Session](2024-11-19-tts-stt-cursor-Session4.md))

The team enhanced version state management and GPU integration to address architectural weaknesses causing inconsistent version states and improper GPU detection. Centralized state management and platform-specific GPU initialization were implemented to improve stability and performance.

## Summary of Session 5 ([Go to Session](2024-11-19-tts-stt-cursor-Session5.md))

The team investigated GitHub release asset management to resolve issues with binary selection and platform detection that were causing installation failures. They planned to improve asset selection logic and implement fallback mechanisms by analyzing GitHub's Release API and similar projects.

## Summary of Session 6 ([Go to Session](2024-11-19-tts-stt-cursor-Session6.md))

Addressing test failures and compilation errors, the team restructured the test infrastructure to align with VS Code extension standards, enabling proper test isolation and fixture management. They centralized version state management for reliable state persistence and improved asset handling with platform-aware selection and better error handling, enhancing test reliability and maintainability.

**Key Points:**
- Reorganized test directory structure following best practices.
- Centralized version state management for consistency.
- Improved asset handling with platform-aware asset selection.
- Enhanced test reliability through proper isolation and management.
- Planned to increase test coverage and update documentation.

## Summary of Session 7 ([Go to Session](2024-11-19-tts-stt-cursor-Session7.md))

The team resolved multiple test failures and TypeScript compilation errors that hindered project validation. Module resolution errors in test files were fixed by correcting TypeScript configurations and import paths, ensuring that tests could properly locate source modules. Test framework issues, such as double-stubbing in Sinon tests and inconsistent version states, were addressed by updating test implementations and default values.

Package dependencies were updated to include missing type definitions and to update deprecated packages like Sinon. The TypeScript compilation setup was completed by adding necessary type definitions and ensuring all dependencies were declared. As a result, all tests passed successfully, with improved execution time and clean TypeScript compilation. Non-critical warnings from deprecated packages were acknowledged, with plans to address them in future updates.

**Key Points:**
- Module resolution errors were fixed in TypeScript configurations.
- Test framework issues like double-stubbing were resolved.
- Package dependencies were updated with necessary type definitions.
- TypeScript compilation setup was completed without errors.
- All tests passed successfully with improved execution time.
- Non-critical warnings from deprecated packages were noted.
- Performance and maintainability were enhanced.
- Proper type definitions ensured reliable module resolution.
- Centralized state management improved reliability.
- Future considerations include updating deprecated dependencies.

## Critical Follow-up: Code Recovery and Implementation Audit

### Issue Identification
During command implementation review, a critical observation emerged:
- Previous working implementations may still exist in the codebase
- Some functional code might have been overwritten or fragmented
- Multiple sources of truth may exist for the same functionality

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Implementation History**
   ```typescript
   // Example of potentially overwritten functionality
   export async function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
       // Current implementation (possibly incomplete)
       await migrateVersionState();
       
       // Previous implementation might have included:
       // - Full command registration
       // - Proper initialization sequence
       // - Working WebView setup
   }
   ```

2. **Contributing Factors**
   - IDE parsing and auto-formatting issues
   - Conflicts between manual edits and LLM suggestions
   - Incremental changes without full context
   - Multiple implementation attempts in different sessions

### Required Actions
1. **Code Archaeology**
   - Review Git history for working implementations
   - Check all source files for duplicate functionality
   - Identify and document all initialization paths

2. **Implementation Audit**
   ```typescript
   // Areas requiring thorough review
   initializeSherpa()        // Multiple versions may exist
   createWebviewPanel()      // Check for working UI code
   handleSTT()/handleTTS()   // Verify core functionality
   ```

3. **Documentation Requirements**
   - Map all command implementations
   - Document initialization sequences
   - Track WebView panel creation
   - List model initialization steps

### Priority Tasks for Next Session
1. **Code Review**
   - [ ] Review Git history for last known working state
   - [ ] Identify all command registration points
   - [ ] Map initialization sequences
   - [ ] Document WebView implementations

2. **Implementation Verification**
   - [ ] Test each discovered implementation
   - [ ] Document working components
   - [ ] Note broken functionality
   - [ ] Create implementation timeline

3. **Recovery Strategy**
   - [ ] Create backup of current state
   - [ ] Document working code fragments
   - [ ] Plan implementation restoration
   - [ ] Design verification tests

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Version Control**
   - Create recovery branches
   - Tag known working states
   - Document implementation attempts

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Create tests for each recovered component
   - Verify initialization sequences
   - Validate command functionality

3. **Documentation**
   - Map all implementation attempts
   - Document working features
   - Track broken functionality

This analysis must be completed before any further implementation work to ensure we don't lose additional working code or create conflicting implementations.
