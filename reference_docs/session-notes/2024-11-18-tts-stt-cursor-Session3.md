# Previous Session Notes Summaries

## Summary of Session 1 ([Go to Session](2024-11-17-tts-stt-cursor-Session1.md))

The project integrates Sherpa-ONNX's real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech processing into Cursor IDE, leveraging a sophisticated multi-threaded architecture built with TypeScript and Node.js. Foundational components like the type system, binary management, version control, and GPU support are established. The team is now addressing a critical initialization failure that occurs during Sherpa initialization, affecting both STT and TTS components.

**Key Points:**
- Established comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for type safety.
- Implemented platform-specific binary management for cross-platform compatibility.
- Developed version control and GPU support infrastructures.
- Identified a critical initialization error: "Please check your config!".
- Immediate tasks include enhancing native module pre-validation and platform-specific validation.

## Summary of Session 2 ([Go to Session](2024-11-18-tts-stt-cursor-Session2.md))

The installation process was failing due to circular dependencies and premature access to VS Code APIs during setup, resulting in errors like "Cannot find module 'vscode'". The root cause was identified as the setup scripts attempting to use VS Code modules before the extension was properly installed, and TypeScript compilation occurring before all dependencies were available. Additionally, there were architectural issues with setup scripts being coupled with the VS Code extension context and platform-specific logic not being properly isolated.

To resolve this, the team restructured the scripts in `package.json`, separating the setup and compilation processes. The setup now only includes basic directory creation using Node.js built-in modules, and VS Code operations are deferred to runtime. This simplification ensures that the setup process is decoupled from runtime concerns, preventing premature access to unavailable modules. Prevention guidelines were also established to avoid similar issues in the future.

**Key Points:**
- Installation failed due to circular dependencies and premature VS Code API access.
- Setup scripts incorrectly attempted to use VS Code modules before installation.
- TypeScript compilation occurred before dependencies were available.
- Restructured scripts to separate setup and compile processes.
- Simplified setup to use only Node.js built-in modules.
- Deferred VS Code API usage to runtime to prevent access errors.
- Addressed architectural issues by decoupling setup and runtime code.
- Isolated platform-specific logic within the appropriate scripts.
- Established code review requirements to prevent similar issues.
- Affected components included `package.json` and setup scripts.

# 2024-11-18 3rd Session Notes

## Version Management System Overhaul

### 1. Initial Analysis
Review of activation logs revealed critical system-level issues:
```
[2024-11-18T16:58:59.296Z] Target Version: 1.10.30
[2024-11-18T16:58:59.296Z] Current Version: 0.0.0
[2024-11-18T17:02:22.757Z] Initial setup failed: Installation validation failed
[2024-11-18T17:02:22.757Z] Version synchronization failed
```

Key observations:
1. Version state inconsistency
   - Package version: 1.10.30
   - System reporting: 0.0.0
   - Downloaded binaries: 1.10.31

2. Redundant Operations
   - Multiple binary downloads (205MB each)
   - Duplicate extraction processes
   - Repeated validation attempts

3. State Management Issues
   - Failed state persistence
   - Incomplete initialization tracking
   - Missing validation checkpoints

### 2. Core System Enhancements
#### 2.1 Version Management
**Problem**: System failing to maintain consistent version state across components.

**Implementation**:
```typescript
export class VersionManager {
    private currentVersion: string = '0.0.0';
    private isValidated: boolean = false;

    async validateVersion(targetVersion: string): Promise<boolean> {
        const actualVersion = this.getActualVersion();
        if (actualVersion === '0.0.0' || actualVersion !== targetVersion) {
            return false;
        }
        this.isValidated = true;
        return true;
    }
}
```

**Key Improvements**:
- Centralized version management
- Atomic version updates
- Validation state tracking
- Proper error propagation

#### 2.2 Binary Management
**Problem**: System downloading and extracting binaries multiple times due to poor state tracking.

**Solution**:
```typescript
async ensureBinariesInstalled(platform: string, arch: string): Promise<boolean> {
    if (this.isValidated) {
        return true;
    }

    const gpuManager = GPUManager.getInstance();
    const hasGPU = await gpuManager.detectGPU();
    
    const downloadResult = await this.downloadBinaries(platform, arch, hasGPU);
    return await this.verifyInstallation();
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Single download per session
- GPU-aware binary selection
- Proper installation verification
- Resource cleanup on failure

### 3. Validation System
#### 3.1 Installation Verification
**Problem**: System failing to validate installations despite successful downloads.

**Implementation**:
```typescript
async verifyInstallation(): Promise<boolean> {
    const platform = process.platform;
    const arch = process.arch;
    const config = PLATFORM_CONFIGS[`${platform}-${arch}`];
    
    const nativeDir = path.join(__dirname, '../../native', `${platform}-${arch}`);
    
    // Verify required files
    for (const file of config.requiredFiles) {
        const filePath = path.join(nativeDir, file);
        if (!fs.existsSync(filePath)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

**Improvements**:
- Platform-specific validation
- Comprehensive file checking
- Detailed error reporting
- State preservation

### 4. State Management
#### 4.1 Initialization State Tracking
**Problem**: System lacking proper initialization state management.

**Solution**:
```typescript
interface InitState {
    versionValidated: boolean;
    binariesInstalled: boolean;
    modelsValidated: boolean;
    gpuInitialized: boolean;
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear initialization status
- Proper cleanup triggers
- Race condition prevention
- Enhanced debugging
