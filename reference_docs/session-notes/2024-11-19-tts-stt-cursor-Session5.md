# Previous Session Notes Summaries

## Summary of Session 1 ([Go to Session](2024-11-17-tts-stt-cursor-Session1.md))

The TTS-STT Cursor Extension project aims to integrate Sherpa-ONNX's speech processing capabilities into the Cursor IDE using TypeScript and native Node.js bindings. The foundational infrastructure is complete, but the team is currently debugging a critical initialization failure manifesting as a "Please check your config!" error.

## Summary of Session 2 ([Go to Session](2024-11-18-tts-stt-cursor-Session2.md))

The team resolved an installation failure caused by circular dependencies and premature access to VS Code APIs during setup. By restructuring the setup scripts and deferring VS Code API usage to runtime, they ensured a successful installation process.

## Summary of Session 3 ([Go to Session](2024-11-18-tts-stt-cursor-Session3.md))

The team overhauled the version management system after identifying critical issues such as version state inconsistency, redundant binary downloads, and poor state management leading to installation failures. By centralizing version management, implementing atomic version updates, and enhancing binary management to prevent redundant downloads, they improved the validation process and overall system performance.

**Key Points:**
- Identified inconsistent version states causing installation failures.
- Centralized version management for consistent version tracking.
- Implemented validation state tracking to monitor system status.
- Enhanced binary management to prevent redundant downloads.
- Improved installation verification with platform-specific checks.

## Summary of Session 4 ([Go to Session](2024-11-19-tts-stt-cursor-Session4.md))

The team confronted architectural weaknesses that were causing inconsistent version states and improper GPU integration. Inconsistent version states led to binary installation failures and unreliable system behavior, while GPU detection and initialization were occurring at incorrect points, lacking proper platform-specific handling and fallback mechanisms. Additionally, state management was decentralized, causing race conditions and overlapping state across components.

To address these issues, centralized state management was implemented, providing a single source of truth and reducing race conditions. GPU integration was enhanced with platform-specific initialization sequences, proper resource management, and robust fallback mechanisms to ensure reliable GPU detection and usage. Version management was improved to allow minor version updates, enhancing flexibility and compatibility. These changes resulted in immediate stability improvements, better performance, and anticipated long-term benefits in system reliability and development efficiency.

**Key Points:**
- Inconsistent version states were causing failures.
- GPU detection occurred after binary selection, causing issues.
- Decentralized state management led to race conditions.
- Centralized state management reduced inconsistencies.
- Platform-specific GPU initialization improved GPU support.
- Version flexibility was enhanced to allow minor updates.
- Immediate stability and performance improvements were achieved.
- Better resource management and error handling were implemented.
- Long-term system reliability was enhanced.
- Development efficiency improved due to simplified debugging.

# 2024-11-19 5th Session Notes

## GitHub Release Asset Management Investigation

### 1. Current Challenge
Analysis of activation logs reveals issues with binary selection and platform detection:
```
[2024-11-18T21:25:53.774Z] Asset sherpa-onnx-v1.10.31-win-x64-cuda.tar.bz2: {"os":"win32","arch":"x64","type":"gpu"}
[2024-11-18T21:25:53.779Z] Failed to ensure native files: Binary installation failed
```

Key Issues:
1. Asset parsing succeeds but installation fails
2. Platform information correctly extracted but not properly utilized
3. Version compatibility checks may be too strict

### 2. Research Objectives
#### 2.1 GitHub API Understanding
- How does GitHub's Release API expose asset information?
- What metadata is available per asset?
- Are there API limitations we need to consider?

#### 2.2 Asset Selection Strategy
Current approach:
```typescript
async getCompatibleAssets(platform: string, arch: string): Promise<SherpaAsset[]> {
    // Current implementation may be too rigid
    return assets.filter(asset => 
        asset.platform.os === platform && 
        asset.platform.arch === arch
    );
}
```

Required improvements:
1. Platform variant handling (shared/static)
2. GPU capability detection
3. Fallback mechanisms

### 3. Similar Project Analysis
1. **node-gyp**
   - Binary download management
   - Platform detection
   - Build fallbacks

2. **electron**
   - Release asset management
   - Platform-specific downloads
   - Version compatibility

3. **VSCode Extensions**
   - Native module handling
   - Platform compatibility
   - Installation validation

### 4. Next Steps
1. Research GitHub's Release API documentation
2. Analyze similar projects' implementations
3. Design improved asset selection logic
4. Implement proper fallback mechanisms

### 5. Questions to Answer
1. What exactly determines binary compatibility?
2. How should we handle version mismatches?
3. What's the proper way to validate downloaded binaries?
4. How can we improve error handling and recovery?
