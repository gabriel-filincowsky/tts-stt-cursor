# Previous Session Notes Summaries

## Summary of Session 1 ([Go to Session](2024-11-17-tts-stt-cursor-Session1.md))

The TTS-STT Cursor Extension represents an ambitious integration of Sherpa-ONNX's advanced speech processing into the Cursor IDE environment. Built on TypeScript with native Node.js bindings, it features a multi-threaded architecture designed for real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionalities. The project has successfully established foundational infrastructure, including type systems, platform-specific binary management, version control systems, and GPU support infrastructure.

Core systems integration is active, with operational model management and GPU detection logic. However, the team is currently facing a critical initialization failure that presents as a "Please check your config!" error during Sherpa initialization. This error occurs post-configuration validation and affects both STT and TTS components. Recent progress includes enhanced logging, centralized logging systems, and validation improvements to address this issue.

**Key Points:**
- Comprehensive type system architecture established.
- Platform-specific binary management implemented.
- Version control and GPU support infrastructures developed.
- Core systems integration with model management operational.
- GPU detection and fallback logic implemented.
- Critical initialization failure identified during Sherpa startup.
- Error affects both STT and TTS components after config validation.
- Enhanced logging and centralized logging systems implemented.
- Validation improvements made to address initialization failure.
- Immediate focus on native module pre-validation and platform-specific validation enhancements.

# 2024-11-18 2nd Session Notes

## Installation Process Failure Resolution

### Issue Summary
Installation failed due to circular dependencies and premature VS Code API access during setup:
- Setup scripts attempting to use VS Code modules before installation
- TypeScript compilation occurring before dependencies were available
- Error: `Cannot find module 'vscode'`

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Script Execution Order**
   - Premature TypeScript compilation
   - VS Code dependencies unavailable during setup
   - Circular dependency in setup scripts

2. **Architecture Issues**
   - Setup scripts coupled with VS Code extension context
   - Mixed concerns between setup and runtime code
   - Platform-specific logic not properly isolated

### Solution
1. **Restructured Scripts**
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "vscode:prepublish": "npm run compile",
     "compile": "tsc -p ./",
     "setup": "node scripts/setup-models.js && node scripts/setup-native.js"
   }
   ```

2. **Simplified Setup Process**
   - Basic directory creation only during setup
   - VS Code operations deferred to runtime
   - Platform-specific logic isolated

### Prevention Guidelines
1. **Setup Scripts**
   - Use only Node.js built-in modules
   - No VS Code API dependencies
   - Handle errors with proper exit codes

2. **Code Review Requirements**
   - Verify setup/runtime separation
   - Check for platform-specific isolation
   - Validate error handling

### Affected Components
- `package.json`: Script definitions
- `setup-models.js`: Directory setup
- `setup-native.js`: Platform setup
- `version-manager.ts`: Runtime version management
- `output-channel.ts`: Runtime logging
