   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "rootDir": "..",
       "outDir": "../out",
       "types": ["mocha", "node", "sinon", "assert"],
       "paths": {
         "*": ["node_modules/*", "src/types/*"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Version State Management**
   ```typescript
   private getDefaultState(): VersionState {
       return {
           targetVersion: '1.10.30',
           currentVersion: '1.10.30',
           lastCheck: new Date().toISOString(),
           installedBinaries: []
       };
   }
   ```

3. **GPU Fallback Mechanism**
   ```typescript
   async getGPUBinaryPattern(version: string): Promise<string | null> {
       const hasGPU = await this.checkGPUAvailability();
       if (!hasGPU) {
           return config.gpuSupport.fallbackToCPU ? config.binaryPattern : null;
       }
       return `${config.binaryPattern}-cuda`;
   }
   ```

## Command Registration and Extension Activation Analysis

### Initial Trigger
Investigation began when command execution failed with "command not found" errors, revealing deeper architectural issues:
- Commands registered in `package.json` but not properly implemented
- Incomplete extension activation sequence
- Missing initialization steps in core functionality
- Previous working implementations potentially overwritten or fragmented

### Issue Analysis
1. **Command Registration Gaps**
   ```json
   {
     "commands": [
       { "command": "tts-stt-cursor.startSTT" },
       { "command": "tts-stt-cursor.startTTS" }
     ]
   }
   ```
   - Commands defined but not properly registered in extension
   - Inconsistent command prefixes (`tts-stt-cursor` vs `tts-stt`)
   - Missing implementation for some commands
   - Potential loss of working implementations

2. **Activation Sequence Issues**
   ```typescript
   export async function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
       // Version management initialization present
       await migrateVersionState();
       
       // Missing critical components:
       // - Command registration
       // - WebView initialization
       // - Model initialization
       
       // Previous implementation might have included:
       // - Full command registration
       // - Proper initialization sequence
       // - Working WebView setup
   }
   ```

3. **Dependency Chain and Implementation History**
   - Version management → GPU detection → Model initialization
   - Command registration → WebView setup → UI state
   - Model initialization → Command functionality
   - Multiple implementation attempts across different sessions
   - Possible conflicts between manual edits and LLM suggestions
   - Incremental changes without full context preservation

### Solution Selection Rationale
Chose a holistic approach with code archaeology because:
1. Command registration affects multiple components
2. Initialization sequence requires careful ordering
3. Dependencies need proper management
4. Previous working code needs recovery
5. Multiple sources of truth may exist

### Implementation Status and Recovery Plan
1. **Completed**
   - Package.json command definitions cleaned up
   - Activation events properly defined
   - Basic extension structure established
   - Initial code archaeology started

2. **In Progress**
   - Command registration implementation
   - WebView panel initialization
   - Model initialization sequence
   - Git history review for working implementations
   - Source file audit for duplicate functionality

3. **Pending**
   - Command functionality implementation
   - UI state management
   - Error handling improvements
   - Working code fragment recovery
   - Implementation timeline documentation

### Technical Debt and Recovery Strategy
1. **Command Inconsistencies**
   - Need to standardize command prefixes
   - Remove duplicate commands
   - Update command documentation
   - Map all command implementations
   - Document initialization sequences

2. **Initialization Order**
   - Document dependency requirements
   - Add initialization checks
   - Implement proper cleanup
   - Track WebView panel creation
   - List model initialization steps

3. **Error Handling and State Management**
   - Add comprehensive error messages
   - Implement recovery mechanisms
   - Add telemetry for failures
   - Create backup of current state
   - Document working code fragments

### Implementation Verification Plan
1. **Code Review**
   ```typescript
   // Areas requiring thorough review
   initializeSherpa()        // Multiple versions may exist
   createWebviewPanel()      // Check for working UI code
   handleSTT()/handleTTS()   // Verify core functionality
   ```

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Create tests for each recovered component
   - Verify initialization sequences
   - Validate command functionality
   - Test each discovered implementation
   - Document working components

3. **Version Control**
   - Create recovery branches
   - Tag known working states
   - Document implementation attempts
   - Track broken functionality
   - Create implementation timeline

### Risk Mitigation and Documentation
1. **Source Control**
   - Regular backups of working states
   - Clear commit messages documenting functionality
   - Branch strategy for implementation attempts
   - Tags for known working versions

2. **Implementation Documentation**
   - Detailed function mappings
   - Initialization sequence diagrams
   - Dependency chains
   - State management flows
   - Recovery procedures

3. **Testing Framework**
   - Component-level tests
   - Integration tests
   - State management tests
   - Recovery verification
   - Performance benchmarks

This comprehensive analysis and recovery plan must be executed systematically before proceeding with new implementation work. The focus is on preserving and recovering working code while establishing a solid foundation for future development.
